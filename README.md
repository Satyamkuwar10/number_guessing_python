Guess The Number Game in Python – Mini Project
This is one of the simple python projects for beginners but still the interesting one. In this project, we will create a python program in which the system will choose a random number between any ranges defined, and then the user is given a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses the number wrongly, he is given another clue leading him towards the answer. The clue can be of any type like smaller, greater, multiples, dividers, etc. We will also need a function for checking the input is correct or not and to check the difference between the original number and the number guessed.

What we are gonna do?
The random function generates the number between 1 to 100. The user has 10 chances to guess the number. So, we ask max 10 times to user to enter a number. Once the user guess is matched with an actual number then the game is over. Every time user also sees how many no. of chances are left. If the user can’t guess the number then the game is over. Simple!!

Which Python concepts are covered?
If-else
While Loop
Random function
break statement
